- ‚úÖ [Text generation](https://localai.io/features/text-generation/) with GPTs
- ‚úÖ [Function calling](https://localai.io/features/openai-functions/) by GPTs üÜï
- ‚úÖ [Model Gallery](https://localai.io/models/) to list and install models
- ‚úñÔ∏è [Vision API](https://localai.io/features/gpt-vision/) for image chats
- ‚úñÔ∏è [Image generation](https://localai.io/features/image-generation) with stable diffusion
- ‚úñÔ∏è [Audio to Text](https://localai.io/features/audio-to-text/)
- ‚úñÔ∏è [Text to Audio](https://localai.io/features/text-to-audio/)

## Guide

### LocalAI installation and configuration

Follow the guide at: https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/

- verify it works by browsing to [http://localhost:8080/v1/models](http://localhost:8080/v1/models)
  (or the IP:Port of the machine, if running remotely) and seeing listed the model(s) you downloaded
  listed in the JSON response.

### Integration: chat with LocalAI

- Go to Models > Add a model source of type: **LocalAI**
- Enter the default address: `http://localhost:8080`, or the address of your localAI cloud instance
  ![configure models](pixels/config-localai-1-models.png)
  - If running remotely, replace localhost with the IP of the machine. Make sure to use the **IP:Port** format
- Load the models (click on `Models üîÑ`)
- Select the model and chat

### Integration: Models Gallery

If the running LocalAI instance is configured with a [Model Gallery](https://localai.io/models/):

- Go to Models > LocalAI
- Click on `Gallery Admin`
- Select the models to install, and view installation progress

## Troubleshooting

##### Unknown Context Window Size

At the time of writing, LocalAI does not publish the model `context window size`.
Every model is assumed to be capable of chatting, and with a context window of 4096 tokens.
Please update the [src/modules/llms/transports/server/openai/models.data.ts](../src/modules/llms/server/openai/models.data.ts)
file with the mapping information between LocalAI model IDs and names/descriptions/tokens, etc.

# Customizing and Creating Derivative Applications

This document outlines how to develop applications derived from big-AGI.

## Manual Customization

Application customization _requires manual code modifications or the use of environment variables_. Currently, **there is no admin panel to "managed" deployment customization** for enterprise use cases.

## Code Alterations

Start by creating a fork of the [big-AGI repository](https://github.com/enricoros/big-AGI) on GitHub for a personal development space.
Understand the Architecture: big-AGI uses Next.js, React for the front end, and Node.js (Next.js edge functions) for the back end.

### Add Authentication

This necessitates a code change (file renaming) before build initiation, detailed in [deploy-authentication.md](deploy-authentication.md).

### Increase Vercel Functions Timeout

For long-running operations, Vercel allows paid deployments to increase the timeout on Functions.
Note that this applies to old-style Vercel Functions (based on Node.js) and not the new Edge Functions.

At time of writing, big-AGI has only 2 operations that run on Node.js Functions:
browsing (fetching web pages) and sharing. They both can exceed 10 seconds, especially
when fetching large pages or waiting for websites to be completed.

We provide `vercel_PRODUCTION.json` to raise the duration to 25 seconds (from a default of 10), to use it,
make sure to rename it to `vercel.json` before build.

From the Vercel Project > Settings > General > Build & Development Settings,
you can for instance set the build command to:

```bash
mv vercel_PRODUCTION.json vercel.json; next build
```

### Change the Personas

Edit the `src/data.ts` file to customize personas. This file houses the default personas. You can add, remove, or modify these to meet your project's needs.

- [ ] Modify `src/data.ts` to alter default personas

### Change the UI

Adapt the UI to match your project's aesthetic, incorporate new features, or exclude unnecessary ones.

- [ ] Adjust `src/common/app.theme.ts` for theme changes: colors, spacing, button appearance, animations, etc
- [ ] Modify `src/common/app.config.tsx` to alter the application's name
- [ ] Update `src/common/app.nav.tsx` to revise the navigation bar

## Testing & Deployment

Test your application thoroughly using local development (refer to README.md for local build instructions). Deploy using your preferred hosting service. big-AGI supports deployment on platforms like Vercel, Docker, or any Node.js-compatible service, especially those supporting NextJS's "Edge Runtime."

- [deploy-cloudflare.md](deploy-cloudflare.md): for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- [deploy-docker.md](deploy-docker.md): for Docker deployment instructions and examples

## Debugging

We introduced the `/info/debug` page that provides a detailed overview of the application's environment, including the API keys, environment variables, and other configuration settings.

## Community Projects - Share Your Project

After deployment, share your project with the community. We will link to your project to help others discover and learn from your work.

For public projects, update your README.md with your modifications and submit a pull request to add your project to our list, aiding in its discovery.

## Best Practices

- **Stay Updated**: Frequently merge updates from the main big-AGI repository to incorporate bug fixes and new features.
- **Keep It Open Source**: Consider maintaining your derivative as open source to foster community contributions.
- **Engage with the Community**: Leverage platforms like GitHub, Discord, or Reddit for feedback, collaboration, and project promotion.

Developing a derivative application is an opportunity to explore new possibilities with AI and share your innovations with the global community. We look forward to seeing your contributions.

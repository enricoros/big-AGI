# Installation Guide

Welcome to the big-AGI Installation Guide - Whether you're a developer
eager to explore, a system integrator, or an enterprise looking for a
white-label solution, this comprehensive guide ensures a smooth setup
process for your own instance of big-AGI and related products.

**Try big-AGI** - You don't need to install anything if you want to play with big-AGI
and have your API keys to various model services. You can access our free instance on [big-AGI.com](https://big-agi.com).
The free instance runs the latest `main-stable` branch from this repository.

## üß© Build-your-own

If you want to change the code, have a deeper configuration,
add your own models, or run your own instance, follow the steps below.

### Local Development

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

**Steps:**

1. Clone the big-AGI repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enricoros/big-AGI.git
   cd big-AGI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Your big-AGI instance is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Local Production build

The production build is optimized for performance and follows
the same steps 1 and 2 as for [local development](#local-development).

3. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   # .. repeat the steps above up to `npm install`, then:
   npm run build
   ```
4. Start the production server:
   ```bash
    next start --port 3000
    ```
   Your big-AGI production instance is on `http://localhost:3000`.

# OpenRouter Configuration

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is a standalone, premium service
that provides access to <Link href='https://openrouter.ai/docs#models' target='_blank'>exclusive AI models</Link>
such as GPT-4 32k, Claude, and more. These models are typically not available to the public.
This document details the process of integrating OpenRouter with big-AGI.

### 1. OpenRouter Account Setup and API Key Generation

1. Register for an OpenRouter account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) by clicking on Sign In > Continue with Google.
2. Top up your account (minimum $5) by navigating to [openrouter.ai/account](https://openrouter.ai/account) > Add Credits > Pay with Stripe.
3. Generate an API key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) > API Key > Generate API Key.
   - **Remember to copy and securely store your API key** - the key will not be displayed again and will be in the format `sk-or-v1-...`.
   - Keep the key confidential as it can be used to expend your credits.

### 2. Integrating OpenRouter with big-AGI

Please note that running large models such as GPT-4 32k can be costly and may rapidly consume
credits - a single prompt may cost $1 or more, at the time of writing.

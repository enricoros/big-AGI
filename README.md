## Why this? 💡

Because the official Chat ___lacks important features___, is ___more limited than the api___, at times
___slow or unavailable___, and you cannot deploy it yourself, remix it, add features, or share it with
your friends.
Our users report that ___big-AGI is faster___, ___more reliable___, and ___features rich___
with features that matter to them.

![Much features, so fun](docs/pixels/big-AGI-compo2b.png)

## Deploy with Docker 🐳

For more detailed information on deploying with Docker, please refer to the [docker deployment documentation](docs/deploy-docker.md).

### 🔧 Locally built image

> Firstly, write all your API keys and env vars to an `.env` file, and make sure the env file is using *both build and run*.
> See [docs/environment-variables.md](docs/environment-variables.md) for a list of all environment variables.

```bash

```bash
docker build -t big-agi .
docker run --detach 'big-agi'
``` 

### Pre-built image

> Warning: the UI will still be asking for keys, as the image was built without the API keys

```bash
docker-compose up
```

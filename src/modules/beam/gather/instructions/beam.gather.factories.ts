You are an advanced analytical tool designed to process and evaluate a set of AI-generated responses related to a user\'s query.

Your objective is to organize these responses in a way that aids decision-making.
You will first identify key criteria essential for evaluating the responses based on relevance, quality, and applicability.

Then, you will analyze each response against these criteria.

Finally, you will synthesize your findings into a table, providing a clear overview of how each response measures up. Start by identifying orthogonal criteria for evaluation (up to 2 for simple evaluations, up to 6 for many pages of input text).`.trim(),
        userPrompt: `
Now that you have reviewed the {{N}} alternatives, proceed with the following steps:

1. **Identify Criteria:** Define the most important orthogonal criteria for evaluating the responses. Identify up to 2 criteria for simple evaluations, or up to 6 for more complex evaluations. Ensure these criteria are distinct and relevant to the responses provided.

2. **Analyze Responses:** Evaluate each response individually against the criteria you identified. Assess how well each response meets each criterion, noting strengths and weaknesses. Be VERY brief and concise in this step, using up to one sentence per response.

3. **Generate Table:** Organize your analysis into a table. The table should have rows for each response and columns for each of the criteria. Fill in the table with 1-100 scores (spread out over the full range) for each response-criterion pair, clearly scoring how well each response aligns with the criteria. 

**Table Format:**

| Response | Criterion 1 | Criterion 2 | ... | Criterion C | Total |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|-------|
| R1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| R2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| RN | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Complete this table to offer a structured and detailed comparison of the {{N}} options, providing an at-a-glance overview that will significantly aid in the decision-making process.

Finally declare the best response.

Only work with the provided {{N}} responses. Begin with listing the criteria.`.trim(),

            A user has reported an issue. Please help them by:

            1. Deep think about the issue:
               **Understand the problem**: Analyze the issue description and any error messages
               **Search for context**:
               - Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for high level guidance and especially kb/ documentation
               - Look in relevant code files, including kb/ documentation
               **Use web search**: When potentially outside Big-AGI (e.g. user configuration), search the web for similar errors or related issues
               **Provide a solution**:
               - Provide multiple solutions if uncertain, and say so
               - If you can fix it in code, propose the fix
                 - If possible also suggest fixes or workarounds for immediate relief
               - Reference specific files and line numbers
               - Test selectively and even npm install and run build if needed to verify the solution
            2. Always add the 'claude-triage' issue label to indicate this issue was triaged by Claude
            3. Comment with:
               - Very brief thank you note, if applicable
               - Initial assessment
               - Next steps or clarification needed
               - Link duplicates if found
            
            If you're uncertain, say so and suggest next steps.
            Be welcoming, helpful, professional, solution-focused and no-BS.
